# TDTM-Tool

Welcome to the TDTM-Tool (Technical Debt Traceability Map) repository! This project is part of my Bachelor's Thesis research, and it is designed to provide a full-stack application for software quality analysis and technical debt traceability. The application leverages quality analysis tools and libraries to help users control and manage software's technical debt.

## Features

- React JS Client Layer application
- Spring Boot Server Layer application
- SonarQube quality analysis integration
- Neo4j graph database Data Layer service
- Dockerized services

## Installation

To set up the project locally, clone tool's repository :
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kostasthomson/TDTM-Tool
   ```

## Usage

To start the dockerized full-stack application, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start the following:
- React application at http://localhost:3005
- Spring Boot application at http://localhost:8085
- SonarQube service at http://localhost:9952
- Neo4j service at http://localhost:7474


This will create, build and run the application and all of its dependent containers.

**Services' credentials**

Î‘ll necessary credentials are contained in the docker-compose file
